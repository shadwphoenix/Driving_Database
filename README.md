# Driving_Database
A project for university

This project was about creating a database using SQL and to provide an app in which the user could moniter fines and points they have and also to be able to pay the fines. Another function was for police officers to add fines or points for an accident and record the accident on the cars vin number and plate. After the first two phases were finished the ability to order road side assistance was added.
